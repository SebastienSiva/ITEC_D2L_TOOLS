# Frequently Asked Questions for the Course Goal Assessment App

### If you combine gradebook entries and specific quiz questions into an assessment score, how do the points combine?

The points are unweighted, so an 100 point assignment and a 10 point quiz question will give a maximum of 110 point total. The current solution for this is to modify the gradebook .csv file in Excel with some formulas to adjust the weight of the assignment.

### Should I keep or remove students who were present for only some of the relevant assessments?

We do not include students who are receiving a _W_ or _NF_ (No show Fail) in this assessment. If there is a more nuanced situation, refer to your course coordinator's guidance on this.
